# News

This project contains a news application developed using the Swift programming language. The application utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to display data obtained from popular news sources. Additionally, the SDWebImage library is employed for loading displayed images efficiently, and the SnapKit library is integrated for interface layout adjustments.

 # Features

- **SDWebImage:** It has been used in the application to load news images quickly and efficiently.
- **SnapKit:** It is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) library used for user interface layout adjustments. This makes Auto Layout code more readable and manageable.

# MVVM Design Pattern
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural design pattern in software development, dividing applications into three key components:

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic, handling data retrieval and storage.
- **View:** Represents the user interface, responsible for displaying data and updating based on changes observed in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel:** Serves as an intermediary, processing data from the Model for presentation in the View. It contains application logic, handling user inputs and interactions.
  
MVVM encourages separation of concerns, enhancing code modularity and simplifying maintenance. It also supports effective unit testing by allowing each component to be tested independently.
